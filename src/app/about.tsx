       <div>
        <p>Richard D Softscape and Landscaping is a company I founded about 15 years ago while working full-time, dedicating my spare time to its growth. With over 30 years of experience in the landscaping industry, I have had the opportunity to work on major projects, including contracts for the NNC in Ottawa and the DND headquarters on Carling Avenue.</p>

        <p>Backed by a team of highly skilled professionals and a strong commitment to excellence, I have built a reputation as a leader in the field. Now, I am ready to take the next stepâ€”running my company full-time with a dedicated small team.</p> 

        <p>We take pride in offering a wide range of services tailored to meet the unique needs of our clients.</p>
